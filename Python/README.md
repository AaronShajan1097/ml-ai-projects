# Python Projects

This folder contains my **Python projects**, organized by difficulty and concepts,
built while strengthening my programming fundamentals for AI/ML engineering.

The projects focus on:
- Problem solving
- Clean and readable code
- Gradual progression from basics to advanced topics

This Python foundation supports my long-term goal of becoming an **AI / ML Engineer**.

## 🧠Learning Progression

### 🔹 Basics
Covers core Python fundamentals such as variables, loops, conditionals,
functions, dictionaries, and logic-based mini projects.

### 🔹 Intermediate
Includes real-world Python applications such as data analysis, GUI programs,
API integration, automation scripts, bots, and web scraping projects.

### 🔹 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Projects focused on class-based design, modular programming, code reusability,
and modeling real-world systems.

### 🔹 Data Structures
Hands-on practice with core data structures to strengthen problem-solving skills
and prepare for technical interviews.

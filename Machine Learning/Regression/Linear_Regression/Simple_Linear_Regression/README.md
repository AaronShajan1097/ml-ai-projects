# Simple Linear Regression

This project implements **Simple Linear Regression** to predict a continuous
target variable using a single feature.

The model is applied to a real-world dataset relating **experience and salary**
to understand how linear relationships are modeled in Machine Learning.

## 📌 What This Project Covers

- Simple linear regression theory
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and prediction
- Relationship between independent and dependent variables
- Visualizing regression results

---

## 📊 Dataset

- `salary_experience.csv`  
  Contains employee experience and corresponding salary data.

---

## 🧠 Approach

The model is implemented using:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

The project demonstrates how a simple regression model is trained,
evaluated, and visualized using standard ML libraries.

## 📂 Files

- `Salary_Prediction.ipynb`  
  Notebook containing data loading, model training, prediction, and visualization.
- `salary_experience.csv`  
  Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned:
- How linear regression models real-world data
- How to interpret regression results
- The difference between theoretical and library-based implementations

This project serves as an entry point into regression-based machine learning models.

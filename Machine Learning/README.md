# Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains my **Machine Learning learning journey**, where I apply
theoretical concepts by building hands-on projects using real-world datasets.

Each project is created after learning the underlying mathematics, intuition,
and practical implementation of the algorithm.

This work forms a core part of my journey toward becoming an **AI / ML Engineer**.

## 🧠 Learning Progression

### 🔹 Regression
Projects focused on predicting continuous values using:
- Simple, multiple, and polynomial regression
- Regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)
- Bias–variance tradeoff
- Implementations using libraries and from scratch

### 🔹 Classification
Projects focused on predicting categorical outcomes using:
- Probabilistic, distance-based, and tree-based models
- Understanding decision boundaries and model comparison
- Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics

### 🔹 Clustering
Unsupervised learning projects aimed at discovering hidden patterns in data using:
- Partition-based methods
- Hierarchical clustering
- Density-based clustering techniques

### 🔹 Dimensionality Reduction
Techniques to reduce feature space while retaining important information, useful for:
- Visualization
- Noise reduction
- Performance optimization

### 🔹 Model Evaluation
Projects focused on assessing and improving model performance using:
- Regression and classification metrics
- Model comparison and validation techniques

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this folder is to build a **strong Machine Learning foundation** by:
- Understanding algorithms conceptually and mathematically
- Applying models to real-world datasets
- Writing clean, reproducible, and well-documented code
- Preparing for real-world AI/ML engineering challenges and interviews

Each project folder contains its own README explaining the dataset,
approach, algorithm used, and key learnings.

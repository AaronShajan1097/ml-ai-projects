# 🧠 ML, AI & Python Projects

This repository contains my **Python, Machine Learning, and AI projects**, built as part of my learning journey toward becoming an **AI / ML Engineer**.

The projects are organized by **difficulty and concept**, starting from Python fundamentals and moving toward automation, data analysis, OOP, and ML-ready skills.

Each folder represents hands-on practice after learning a concept, with a focus on:

* Strong programming fundamentals
* Clean, readable code
* Problem-solving mindset
* Real-world mini-projects
